# Mathematics for Simplicial Complexes Language

In this file I will document the mathematical concepts and structures that I will use to implement the language for simplicial complexes.

## Simplicial Complexes

**Definition:**:
    The **vertices** are *countable ordered* set 
    $$ V := \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, \} $$. 
    Each element of V is called a **vertex**.

**Definition:**
    A **simplicial complex** $ K $ is a collection of finite subsets of V called **simplices** such that:
    $$
        \text{For each } \sigma \in K \text{ and } \tau \subseteq \sigma, \text{} \tau \in K.
    $$
    Each element $ \sigma \in K $ is called a **simplex**.
    So a simplicial complex is a set of simplices closed under the operation of taking non-empty subsets.

**Definition:**
    A **geometric simplex** $ \Delta $ is the convex hull of a set of affine independent points in a Euclidean space.
    A **geometric simplicial complex** $ \mathcal{K} $ is a collection of geometric simplices such that:
        1. Every face of a simplex in the complex is also in the complex.
        2. The intersection of any two simplices in the complex is either empty or a face of both simplices.

**Definition:**
A **geometric realization** of a simplicial complex $ K $ is a geometric simplicial complex $ \mathcal{K} $ such that there is a bijection between the vertices of $ K $ and the vertices of $ \mathcal{K} $, and the simplices of $ K $ correspond to the geometric simplices of $ \mathcal{K} $.

**Remark**:
    It is clear that every **geometric simplicial complex** induces a **simplicial complex** by considering the set of vertices and the combinatorial structure of the simplices.
    It is also true that every **simplicial complex** admits a **geometric realization** in some Euclidean space, but this fact will not be proved here.

**Definition(Dimension):**
    $$
        dim(\sigma) = |\sigma| - 1,
    $$
    
**Definition(Dimension of a Simplicial Complex):**
    $$
        dim(K) = \max_{\sigma \in K} dim(\sigma).
    $$
**Definition(n-skeleton):**
    $$
        K^n := \{\sigma \in K : dim(\sigma) \leq n\}
    $$

### Operations on Simplicial Complexes

The union of two simplicial complex is just their set-theoretic union, we are also always assuming that simplicial complexes are disjoint sets.

**Definition:**
    Given a subset of vertices $ U \subseteq V $, the **generated simplex** $ \sigma(U) $ is defined as:

    $$
        \sigma(U) := \{\sigma \in K : \sigma \subseteq U\}.
    $$

    It is clear that $ \sigma(U) $ is the smallest simplicial complex containing all vertices in $U$.
**Definition:**
    A function $f: K_1^0 \to K_2^0$ is **simplicial** if

    $$
        \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\} \in K_1 \implies \{f(v_1), f(v_2), \ldots, f(v_k)\} \in K_2
    $$

    and it induce a so called **simplicial map** between the simplicial complexes $ K $ and $ K' $.
    A **simplicial isomorphism** is a bijective simplicial map whose inverse is also a simplicial map.

**Definition:**
    Given two simplicial complexes $K_1, K_2$.
    Two subcomplexes $L_1 \subseteq K_1$ and $L_2 \subseteq K_2$, and a simplicial isomorphism $f: L_1 \to L_2$.
    The **glueing** of $K_1$ and $K_2$ along $f$ is the simplicial complex $ K_3 = K_1 \cup_f K_2$ defined as:

    $$
        K_3 := \frac{K_1 \cup K_2}{\sim}
    $$
    
    where $ \sim $ is the equivalence relation generated by $ v \sim f(v) $ for all $ v \in L_1^0 $.
